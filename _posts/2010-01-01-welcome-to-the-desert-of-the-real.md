Hey there, and welcome to my blog!

Iâ€™m super excited to finally launch this space where Iâ€™ll be sharing thoughts, insights, hands-on projects, and curious findings from the ever-evolving world of **cybersecurity**. Whether you're an enthusiast, a student, or someone just discovering what happens behind digital defenses â€” you're in the right place.

### Who am I?

Iâ€™m currently a student at **Politecnico di Milano**, where I studied **Computer Engineering** and specialized in **Cybersecurity** during my Masterâ€™s degree. But my journey started even earlier â€” across the ocean â€” during a summer campus I attended at **UCLA in Los Angeles**. That experience opened my eyes to the vast universe of programming and technology, and Iâ€™ve never looked back.

> Since then, itâ€™s been all about understanding how systems work, how they fail, and most importantly â€” how to secure them.

### What to expect from this blog?

* Custom security projects and ideas  
* Thoughts on emerging technologies  
* Opinions on security trends and real-world breaches  
* Stories from my academic path and beyond  
* Tools, tips, and tutorials for fellow learners  

This blog is not just a collection of notes â€” it's a **living space** for creativity, exploration, and community.

Letâ€™s build something meaningful â€” and secure â€” together.  
Stay tuned, and welcome once again to the journey! ðŸš€
